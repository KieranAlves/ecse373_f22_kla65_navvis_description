<h2>How to use launch file.</h2>

<p>My launch file takes the arguments 'use_xacro' and 'use_gui'.</p>

<p>By default 'use_xacro' is set to false and 'use_gui' is set to true.<br>
This means that by default the URDF file is run instead of the xacro file,<br>
and that 'joint_state_publisher_gui' will run instead of 'joint_state_publisher'</p>
